# FinalProject
## Overview and Purpose
### I found a very detailed dataset on student achievement in two Portuguese secondary schools (high school equivalent) in regrads to two classes, math and Portuguese. My purpose with this project was to dig deeper into the data and reach a greater understanding of student achievement. I wanted to better understand and predict student acedemic success and failure. To to this I used python in Jupyter notebooks to analyse the data and create visualizations that helped answer a couple of the questions I had about the data.
